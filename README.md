# TetrisAttackAI

This repository experiments with different reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the game of tetris attack (SNES).
These algorithms are currently tested:

- DQN [[1]](#1)

Furthermore we apply the learners to different kinds of game modes, these include:

- Endless: A single agent environment where the goal is to accumulate points and survive as long as possible, just like in tetris.
- VS: A multi agent environment where the goal is to defeat the opponent by sending him blocks via combos. (to be developed)
